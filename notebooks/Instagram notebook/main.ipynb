Trash. The sound is not the best if you are in a room with anyone else since staying connected to Bluetooth is almost impossible. PLEASE FIX. I would love to go back to normal video calls.",

I want the share to story option in at the top in a list format like it has been for however long. I don't want the option at the bottom of the screen.

Unless you only want to see content from accounts with huge followings, you're out of luck. They've made it nearly impossible for small accounts to get noticed by taking away the \"recent\" option.",
